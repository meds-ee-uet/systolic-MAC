# Conceptual Overview

### What is a Systolic Array?
- In parallel computer architectures, a **systolic array** is a homogeneous network of tightly coupled **data processing units (DPUs)** called *cells* or *nodes*.  
- Each node or DPU:
  - Independently computes a partial result as a function of the data received from its upstream neighbours.  
  - Stores the result within itself.  
  - Passes it downstream.

### Applications of Systolic Arrays
ðŸ”¹ **Deep Learning Accelerators (ML)**  
Efficiently perform parallel matrix multiplications in neural networks like **CNNs** and **Transformers**.  

ðŸ”¹ **Image & Signal Processing (DSP)**  
Enable real-time convolution operations for filtering, edge detection, and motion estimation.  

ðŸ”¹ **DNA Sequence Alignment (Biology)**  
Accelerate alignment algorithms like **Smith-Waterman** using parallel dataflow for fast genome matching.  

ðŸ”¹ **MIMO Signal Processing (DSP/Comms)**  
Support high-throughput matrix operations for channel equalization and beamforming in wireless systems.  

...and much more.

# DESIGN OVERVIEW

## Specialty & Performance

- We built the entire **Systolic Array** completely from scratch, covering all modules and interconnections.  
- On a **3 GHz machine**, the full computation completed in just **~15 ns**.  
- This results in a performance that is nearly **50-160** times faster than a general purpose cpu(check the benchmarks section).
