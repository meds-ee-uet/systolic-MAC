##  MAC Unit
- In computing, especially digital signal processing, the **Multiply–Accumulate (MAC)** or **Multiply–Add (MAD)** operation is a common step that:  
  - Computes the product of two numbers.  
  - Adds that product to an accumulator.  

- The MAC operation modifies an accumulator `y`:  
```math
y ← y + (a × b)
```

 For simplicity, in **C code**:  
```c
y += (a * b);
```

- General CPUs are used in **Von Neumann architecture**, but **digital signal processors (DSPs)** use **MACs**.  
- The hardware unit that performs the operation is known as a **Multiplier–Accumulator (MAC Unit)**.
