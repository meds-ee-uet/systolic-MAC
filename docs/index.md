# 4x4 INT Systolic Architecture Based Accelerator for Efficient Matrix Multiplication

Welcome to the documentation for the **4x4 INT Systolic Array Based Accelerator** designed for efficient matrix multiplication.

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

---

## User Guide

TESTING

We tested by six examples , two are shown below :

## Benchmarks
We used a custom benchmark written in C language, which multiplied two randomly generated 8 bit 4x4 matrices into 4x4 32 bit result. We ran it on different processors 6 times and took the average of the findings. The results are shown in the table below.  

![table](benchmark.png)

Hence we observe that the systolic array is approximately **50-160** times faster than main-stream general purpose cpus.
