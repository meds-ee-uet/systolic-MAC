##  Processing Elements / Data Processing Units

- A **Processing Element (PE)**, also called a **Data Processing Unit (DPU)**, is the fundamental building block of a systolic array.  
- Each PE is designed to perform simple operations such as:  
  - Addition  
  - Multiplication  
  - MAC (Multiplyâ€“Accumulate)  
- PEs are connected to their neighbors in a regular pattern, allowing data to **flow step by step**.  
- Together, many PEs work in parallel to achieve high throughput in matrix and vector computations.
